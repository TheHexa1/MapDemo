        An important part of this discovery app\'s experience is the ability to connect to CIM EDUCATIONAL BEACONS. When you reach a
        specific photo location the app will automatically stream fun and educational content to your smart devices. This feature
        depends on specific secure wi-fi beacons, which have been strategically placed in specific locations. In order to
        automatically connect to these beacons, the Android system permissions to Access and Change Wi-Fi state, as well as to
        receive coarse location information, are required.\n\n
        To enable the CIM EDUCATIONAL BEACONS feature, please turn on Wi-Fi Auto-Connect from the app\'s menu, and accept the
        permissions if prompted. If you have permanently denied the permissions (by selecting the \"Never ask again\" checkbox), then
        you can re-enable them through your device\'s settings.
