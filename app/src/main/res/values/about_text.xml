        One of the most scenic and historic spots in Southern California is nestled in the heart of Apple
        Country in Oak Glen, California where the summers are cooler and the winters dusted with
        snow. The five mile scenic loop of more than 30 ranches, farms and businesses are open year-
        round. You will see one of the most scenic byways Southern California has to offer. Enoch
        Parrish opened the first apple orchard in 1876, followed by the Wilshire family. The Rivers
        brothers and their families came to Oak Glen in 1906. Their orchard, Los Rios Rancho (Spanish
        for \"The Rivers Ranch\"), is still in operation, as are many of the other original orchards and
        ranches in the area. The Law family came into the area in the early 1930s and started their own
        apple orchard. They soon built the first roadside packinghouse, first restaurant and gift shops.
        Los Rios Rancho a 103-year-old ranch; Southern California\'s largest historical apple ranch,
        located in the heart of apple country, draws more than 300,000 visitors yearly who make the
        scenic drive to Oak Glen to pick apples, picnic and hike as well as enjoy the ranchos homemade
        apple pies and freshly pressed cider. Joseph E. Wilshire, who helped make the Oak Glen area
        famous for apple growing in the early 1900s, realized early on the suitability of The Glen for
        growing bountiful apples and began buying land where with his brothers George, Henry and
        Edward began the Wilshire legacy years earlier. The original settlers to Oak Glen were the
        Cahuilla and the Serrano Indians. They harvested acorns and ate blackberry and other local foods
        to survive. The unique climate and elevation was perfect for growing large black acorns, a
        favorite among the locals of their time. The evidence can still be found along the streambeds
        where the acorns were leached over 100 years ago. Although the main crop of Oak Glen has
        been apples since the 1940s, it hasn’t always been Oak Glen’s only crop. The potato along with
        many other crops, were grown in Oak Glen since the 1890s. After several farms began to sell
        apples individually to visitors, along with homemade apple pies, fresh apple cider and delicious
        apple butter from roadside stands, Oak Glen became an apple boom town overnight. The apple
        export trade has since virtually disappeared, and growers now earn much of their revenue from
        visitors who are allowed to pick the apples directly from the trees which not only offers guests a
        “back to nature” experience but also provides them with the freshest fruit with superior quality.
        Today many of the heirloom varieties of apples are still grown in the Glen, varieties you would
        be hard pressed to find anywhere else in the world, such as the Arkansas Black.
